# Medical Disease Prediction Web Application

## Description

This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant medical information and receive predictions for Diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and Heart disease. The application leverages machine learning models to provide accurate predictions based on user inputs.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes with an accuracy of 73%.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Employs a Logistic Regression model to predict the presence of heart disease with an accuracy of 82%.
- **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**: Uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model for predicting Parkinson’s disease 87%.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend development and data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data handling.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
